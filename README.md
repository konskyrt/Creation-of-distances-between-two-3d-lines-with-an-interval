# determination-of-distance-between-two-3d-lines-with-an-interval


This is a script created with Dynamo for Civil 3D.

The script takes a set of 3D lines randomly placed, and splits the lines to more parts, given an integral (for this example 10 cm was desired).
Afterwards the script creates perpendicular lines in between the two input lines.

At last, the script extracts the distances at the intersection points of the created lines in an Excel file
